# fCC Data Visualization Projects
Project Challenges for freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Certification

## Visualize Data with a Bar Chart - US GDP
A bar chart depicting the growth of US GDP (1947 - 2015). This is built as a CodePen.io app, retrieving JSON data and processing the dataset via the D3 svg-based visualization library (6.6.2 at time of initial build). HTML, JS, and CSS included, but the primary focus is on generating accurate charts and mouseover tooltips via D3.

## Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph - Cyclist Doping Statistics
A scatterplot graph depicting cyclist doping statistics (1994 - 2016). This is built as a CodePen.io app, testing the D3 svg-based visualization library with a focus on parsed date formatting and cleaner axis ticks. HTML, JS, and CSS included, along with a graph legend and mouseover tooltip.

## Visualize Data with a Heat Map - Land Surface Temperature
A heat map of monthly global land-surface temperatures (1951 - 1980 dataset). This is built as a CodePen.io app, depicting different fill colors split across the dataset's available temperature variances. Using the D3 svg-based library, the heat map contains cells, tooltips, and a legend with corresponding colors based on temperature values.

## Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map - United States Educational Attainment
A choropleth map representing the percentage of adults ages 25 and above with bachelor's degrees or higher (2010 - 2014 dataset). This is built as a CodePen.io app, sketching out a map of the United States into districts predefined by different shades of color in proportion to the percentage of educational attainment. Using the D3 library's geographic path generator, this choropleth map also contains a legend, tooltip, and color hues according to the dataset.
