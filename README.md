## Visualize Data with a Bar Chart - US GDP
A bar chart depicting the growth of US GDP (1947 - 2015). This is built as a CodePen.io app, retrieving JSON data and processing the dataset via the D3 svg-based visualization library (6.6.2 at time of initial build). HTML, JS, and CSS included, but the primary focus is on generating accurate charts and mouseover tooltips via D3.

The [bar chart can be found here.](https://codepen.io/allemandi/full/oNBwrjX "fCC: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart - US GDP")
